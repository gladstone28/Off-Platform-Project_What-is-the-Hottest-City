#### Off-Platform Project: What's the Hottest City?

Use the weather utility from Bash-Snippets to gather and sort temperature data from multiple cities.

**Project Objectives**

This project, which you’ll complete in a Linux environment, reviews the bash scripting skills you’ve learned thus far. You will be creating a bash script that:

- Fetches forecast temperatures for multiple cities.
- Saves those temperatures to a file.
- Sorts the cities based on their temperatures.

You will install and use a modified version of the weather bash script from Bash-Snippets to gather the required forecast information. The weather script gets the location from the user and sends it to the wttr.in API. The API returns a detailed weather forecast of the specified location.
