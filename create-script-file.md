#### Create Script File
Letâ€™s create the shell script file you will be working with, sortCityTemps.sh, and give it permission to execute:

```
$ touch sortCityTemps.sh
$ chmod +x sortCityTemps.sh
```
You can work on this file in either the Ubuntu Desktop Editor (which comes pre-installed), a code editor of your choosing, or inside the terminal itself with nano. You can open the file in Ubuntu Desktop Editor using the command gedit sortCityTemps.sh &. If you decide to use nano, remember that you can save changes to the file using CTRL / CMD + O and exit using CTRL / CMD + X.

Add the line #!/bin/bash to the top of the script and save!
