Conclusion and Suggested Challenges
Congrats! You have successfully completed a project in a Linux Ubuntu environment using your bash scripting skills. You harnessed the power of a weather script written by someone else to make it easier to complete your own tasks.

But don’t stop here! You can further enhance your scripting skills by adding these tweaks to the script you’ve created so far:

- Make the script work with cities with multiple words such as Los Angeles, Hong Kong, or San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca. Try adding a city with a space in the array and see what happens.
- Instead of temperature, try collecting and sorting a different weather value like wind speed. This will require you to edit either our modified weather.sh script or the official Bash-Snippet script. In particular, you would modify the call to the wttr.in API. Take a look at the available parameters for one-line wttr.in outputs.
- Filter out data from the fancy output of the weather script. In the real world, the data you’re after often requires extra steps to extract. Try filtering out the temperature values from the fancy output of the weather script. As a stretch goal, extract additional weather values like wind speed.
- Incorporate a functionality of another script in the Bash-Snippets library. Perhaps use the Qrify script to turn your sorted data into a QR code!
